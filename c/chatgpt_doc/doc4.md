**IRMK Protocol API Documentation**

*Version 0.3.3*

### Introduction

The IRMK Protocol API extends the CWCom Communications Protocol to support closed-circuit telegraphy. This extension enables users to send and receive Morse code signals over the internet, simulating the behavior of a closed-circuit telegraph system. The API defines the packet structures and functions necessary for communication.

---

### Packet Structure

#### Command Packets

- `DIS`: 0x0002 (Disconnect)
- `DAT`: 0x0003
- `CON`: 0x0004 (Connect)
- `ACK`: 0x0005

#### Sizes

- `SIZE_COMMAND_PACKET`: 4 bytes
- `SIZE_DATA_PACKET`: 496 bytes
- `SIZE_DATA_PACKET_PAYLOAD`: 492 bytes (SIZE_DATA_PACKET - SIZE_COMMAND_PACKET)
- `SIZE_ID`: 128 bytes
- `SIZE_STATUS`: 128 bytes
- `SIZE_CODE`: 51 integers

#### Structures

**Command Packet Format**
```c
struct command_packet_format {
    unsigned short command; // CON / DIS
    unsigned short channel; // Channel number
};
```

**Data Packet Format**
```c
struct data_packet_format {
    unsigned short command;
    unsigned short length;
    char id[SIZE_ID];
    char a1[4];
    unsigned int sequence;
    unsigned int a21;
    unsigned int a22;
    unsigned int a23;
    signed int code[SIZE_CODE];
    unsigned int n;
    char status[SIZE_STATUS];
    char a4[8];
};
```

### Functions

#### `int prepare_id(struct data_packet_format *id_packet, char *id)`

Prepares the ID packet for transmission. Initializes the packet structure with the provided ID.

#### `int prepare_tx(struct data_packet_format *tx_packet, char *id)`

Prepares the transmission packet. Initializes the packet structure with the provided ID and default values.

#### `void identifyclient(void)`

Connects to the server and sends the ID packet.

#### `int send_latch(void)`

Sends a latch signal to the server.

#### `int send_unlatch(void)`

Sends an unlatch signal to the server.

### Closed-Circuit Extension

The extension introduces special timing values `+1` and `+2`:
- `+1`: Signals the beginning of a long mark. Latches the circuit closed until the end of the following mark.
- `+2`: Signals the end of a long mark. Unlatches the circuit.

---

### MorseKOB Operation - Sending

- The program enters latched mode when the operator closes the key.
- If the key remains closed, the program assumes the circuit is closed indefinitely and sends a `+1` timing element.
- When the key is opened, the program sends `(â€“n, +2)`, where `n` is the length of the key-down period.

### MorseKOB Operation - Receiving

- Upon receiving a `+1` code element, the program closes its local circuit until a mark longer than 1 ms is received.
- Received code elements are buffered before processing to eliminate jitter caused by varying character lengths or network transmission delays.
- A delay is introduced to prevent simultaneous transmissions, reducing the chance of collisions.

---

### Break Behavior

- Users can interrupt transmissions by opening their key, causing all sounders on the wire to go silent.
- The breaking user gains control of the wire.
- The sender can regain control by toggling the Circuit Closer.

---

### Compatibility

- Compatible with both CWCom server and client programs.
- Allows seamless communication between users from different systems.
- Handles circuit closures and breaks for smooth interaction.

---

### Conclusion

The IRMK Protocol API provides a robust and efficient way to simulate closed-circuit telegraphy over the internet. By extending the CWCom Communications Protocol, the API ensures realistic behavior and compatibility, allowing users to experience a faithful recreation of a closed circuit telegraph system.
