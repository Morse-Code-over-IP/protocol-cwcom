Certainly! The `txloop` function in the provided code is the core of the message sending mechanism. It handles the translation of Morse code key presses and releases into audio signals that are transmitted back to the server. Let's break down the `txloop` function in detail:

```c
void txloop(void) {
    key_press_t1 = fastclock();
    tx_timeout = 0;
    for (;;) {
        // Increase the Morse code signal count
        tx_data_packet.n++;

        // Encoding key press duration as a negative integer in Morse code packet
        tx_data_packet.code[tx_data_packet.n - 1] =
            (int)((key_press_t1 - key_release_t1) * -1);

        // Detect key release time
        key_release_t1 = fastclock();

        // Encoding key release duration as a positive integer in Morse code packet
        tx_data_packet.n++;
        tx_data_packet.code[tx_data_packet.n - 1] =
            (int)((key_release_t1 - key_press_t1) * 1);

        // Detect key press time for the next iteration
        key_press_t1 = fastclock();

        // Check for the end of the Morse code packet
        if (tx_data_packet.n == SIZE_CODE) {
            printf("irmc: warning packet is full.\n");
            return;
        }
    }
}
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - `key_press_t1 = fastclock();`: Records the current timestamp as the starting time of the key press.
   - `tx_timeout = 0;`: Initializes the timeout counter.

2. **Transmission Loop:**
   - The function enters an infinite loop, continuously detecting key presses and releases to form Morse code signals.

3. **Key Press Duration Encoding (Negative Integer):**
   - `(int)((key_press_t1 - key_release_t1) * -1);`: Calculates the duration of the key press by subtracting the release time from the press time and negates the result. The negative value indicates a key press in the Morse code packet.

4. **Key Release Duration Encoding (Positive Integer):**
   - `(int)((key_release_t1 - key_press_t1) * 1);`: Calculates the duration of the key release by subtracting the press time from the release time. The positive value indicates a key release in the Morse code packet.

5. **Adding Morse Code Signals to the Packet:**
   - The calculated key press and release durations are added to the `tx_data_packet` structure. The `n` variable keeps track of the number of Morse code signals in the packet.
   - The loop continues until the packet is full (`tx_data_packet.n == SIZE_CODE`), indicating that the packet can no longer accommodate additional Morse code signals.

6. **Packet Overflow Handling:**
   - If the packet becomes full, a warning message is printed, indicating that the packet is full, and the function returns. This prevents overflowing the packet structure.

In summary, the `txloop` function continuously monitors key press and release events, encodes their durations as Morse code signals, and adds these signals to the `tx_data_packet` structure. The Morse code packet is then ready to be sent to the server for further processing and transmission.
