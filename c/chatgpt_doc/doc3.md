In the provided code, the `tx_data_packet.n` variable is sent when the transmission loop in the `txloop` function completes, and the Morse code packet is ready to be transmitted to the server. Specifically, the transmission of the `tx_data_packet` structure occurs in the main loop of the program, within the following block of code:

```c
if (tx_data_packet.n > 1) {
    tx_sequence++;
    tx_data_packet.sequence = tx_sequence;
    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) 
        send(fd_socket, &tx_data_packet, SIZE_DATA_PACKET, 0);
    tx_data_packet.n = 0;
#if DEBUG
    printf("irmc: sent data packet.\n");
#endif
}
```

Here's what happens in this block:

1. **Transmission Condition:**
   - `if (tx_data_packet.n > 1) { ... }`: Checks if the Morse code packet contains more than one Morse code signal. If it does, indicating that the packet has Morse code signals to be transmitted, the code inside the block is executed.

2. **Packet Transmission:**
   - `tx_sequence++;`: Increments the transmission sequence number for the packet.
   - `tx_data_packet.sequence = tx_sequence;`: Sets the sequence number of the Morse code packet to the incremented `tx_sequence`.
   - `for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) send(fd_socket, &tx_data_packet, SIZE_DATA_PACKET, 0);`: Sends the Morse code packet five times to enhance reliability. The packet is sent using the `send` function over the UDP socket (`fd_socket`).
   - `tx_data_packet.n = 0;`: Resets the Morse code signal count (`tx_data_packet.n`) to 0 after the packet transmission, indicating that the packet has been sent.

3. **Debugging Output (Optional):**
   - `#if DEBUG`: Checks if the program is in debug mode.
   - `printf("irmc: sent data packet.\n");`: Prints a debug message indicating that the data packet has been sent.

In summary, the `tx_data_packet.n` variable is sent along with the entire Morse code packet (`tx_data_packet`) to the server when the conditions for transmission are met. This ensures that the Morse code signals generated in the `txloop` function are transmitted to the server for further processing and communication.
